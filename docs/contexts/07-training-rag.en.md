# CONTEXT — Nexova

## Milestone 7 — RAG & Knowledge Base

---

## 1. Introduction

Marcos Ibáñez (Sales Director) has 18 people between account managers and SDRs repeating the same explanations to every prospect: what each service line includes, how the pricing model works, how long a typical headhunting process takes. When an SDR is new, it takes them weeks to give confident answers without escalating to a senior account manager.

The **brief** Marcos sent through an internal **RFP** asks for an assistant any SDR can use before or during a call with a prospect, answering **from the perspective of a Nexova salesperson**: confident, closing-oriented, and never inventing commercial terms that don't exist.

Your knowledge base must be built from the source documents in section 2.

## 2. Knowledge Base Source Documents

Use the following source documents as the base for your knowledge base. Copy them from [`00-general-contexts/nexova/`](../00-general-contexts/nexova/) into `docs/company-knowledge-base/` in your monorepo. Each has been split into its own file so you can load it directly into your chunking pipeline.

## 4. Answer KPIs and Thresholds

- **Recall@3**: at least 80% of test questions must have the correct chunk
  among the top 3 retrieved results.
- **Faithfulness**: no percentage, amount, or timeframe mentioned in the
  answer may differ from what's stated in the retrieved chunks.
- For questions about discounts or conditions not covered in the documents
  (for example, a discount from 22% to 15%), the answer must state that
  condition requires approval and must not invent it.

---

- **Minimum similarity threshold**: define a threshold and document why you
  chose it; if no chunk exceeds it, the answer must explicitly state there
  isn't enough information — it must never make something up.

## 5. Seed Data Instructions

- Index all four complete source documents listed in section 2.
- Each document must produce at least 3 chunks.
- Create `data/eval/test-queries.json` with at least 8 questions, including
  at least two real sales objections taken from `nexova-objection-handling.en.md`.

---

## 6. Business Constraints

- A discount below the 22% fee must never be offered in a generated
  answer — the system must defer that decision to a human.
- Delivery times must always be presented as averages, not guarantees,
  except for the 6-month replacement guarantee, which is contractual.
- Answers about competitor clients must maintain the transparency indicated
  in `nexova-objection-handling.en.md`.

---

## 7. Expected Deliverables

- A knowledge base indexed in Qdrant containing all four source documents.
- A FastAPI endpoint that answers questions like "how much does an 8-week
  training program cost?" or "what happens if the shortlist doesn't work
  for me?" with a generated answer traceable back to its source.
- A minimal query interface working against that endpoint.
